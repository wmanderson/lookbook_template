Designed to work with [Everlane Lookbook Template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9sjwraqbs4jfmff/20161010_Everlane_Lookbook.sketch?dl=0). 

## How-To 

#### Step 1: Select Files

Once you’re ready to review your design, you need to export it from Sketch. But rather than export the entire design, you’ll want to export each section individually.

#### Step 2: Export Files

Select each section, and click export (located on the bottom right of your screen). 
- Note: Do not rename the files. 

Export the files into the `img` folder, which is located within the `lookbook_template-master` folder you downloaded from this page.

### Step 3: Open in Browser

Finally, just open the prototype in your browser by double clicking the `index.html` file (located in the `lookbook_template-master` folder). 

Your design should automatically open in your browser. Scroll through and check it out!
